You can put data packs in this directory, these
can be either directory or zip based.

All the data packs require a 'pack.mcmeta' file with the
pack format that is used. Currently are only the mc data pack
'3' and the 'lantern' data pack versions supported.

You can also add a 'plugin.info' to your data pack domain
directory, for example'minecraft' or 'lantern' that you get
'data/<domain>/path/to/asset.json'. This provides extra
plugin information about what the features the package will
provide and who designed the data pack. This is similar to
the 'mcmod.info' file.

DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE, IT IS USED TO RECOGNIZE
THE TEST DATA PACKS DIRECTORY AT RUNTIME
