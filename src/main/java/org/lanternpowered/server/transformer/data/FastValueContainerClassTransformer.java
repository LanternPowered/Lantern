/**
 * This {@link ClassTransformer} attempts to replace method calls inside {@link CompositeValueStore}s
 * that return {@link DataTransactionResult}. A lot of times are these {@link DataTransactionResult}s
 * discarded and this make it pointless to generate these. Replacing these methods with fast equivalents
 * in these cases that avoid {@link DataTransactionResult} object creations. Fast methods will always
 * return a {@code boolean} value that represents if the action was successful.
 * <p>All the fast methods are present in the {@link ICompositeValueStore}, every {@link CompositeValueStore}
 * should use this expansion interface to support fast methods. If this isn't the case it will fall back
 * to the original methods.
 * <p>Some examples:
 * <p>This is a simple example where you offer health to a entity. The offer method returns
 * a {@link DataTransactionResult} but is never used.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * final Entity entity = ...;
 * entity.offer(Keys.HEALTH, 2.0);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The code above will be replaced by:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * final Entity entity = ...;
 * CompositeValueStoreHelper.offer(entity, Keys.HEALTH, 2.0);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * A helper class ({@link CompositeValueStoreHelper}) is here used to check if the {@link Entity} the
 * {@link ICompositeValueStore} value extends and then calls the fast method, otherwise it will fall
 * back to the original method. The helper class makes it easy to transform the code, without adding
 * extra lines in it, only the method call has to be modified.
 * <p>
 * Another example, we know in this case that the {@link Entity} is a {@link ICompositeValueStore},
 * because it is first casted to {@link LanternEntity} which implements that interface.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * final Entity entity = ...;
 * final LanternEntity entity1 = (LanternEntity) entity;
 * entity1.offer(Keys.HEALTH, 2.0);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This will be replaced by:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * final Entity entity = ...;
 * final LanternEntity entity1 = (LanternEntity) entity;
 * entity1.offerFast(Keys.HEALTH, 2.0);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Then is there also a case where the {@link DataTransactionResult} is actually used, but only to
 * check if it was successful ({@link DataTransactionResult#isSuccessful()}). This can also be represented
 * by the {@code boolean} value that is returned by the fast methods. In this case will the following
 * transformation occur.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * final Entity entity = ...;
 * final LanternEntity entity1 = (LanternEntity) entity;
 * boolean success = entity1.offer(Keys.HEALTH, 2.0).isSuccessful();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This will be replaced by:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * final Entity entity = ...;
 * final LanternEntity entity1 = (LanternEntity) entity;
 * boolean success = entity1.offerFast(Keys.HEALTH, 2.0);
 * }
 * </pre>
